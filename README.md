# TTN Mapper Android App Version 2
This is still a work in progress. Contributions are welcome, but impractical at this stage because the codebase is still changing rapidly.

# Current Progress
Currently the app should be in a Alpa usable state.

## TODO's:
* Auto zooming
* Auto centering
* Coverage layer
* Loradrive mode
* Only one gateway shown per packet
